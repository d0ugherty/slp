# Studies in Logic & Probability - George Boole

This is a repository for notes while I read through "Studies in Logic & Probability" - a collection of mathmetician George Boole's essays. In here you will find Jupyter notebooks demonstrating his ideas. I figured this would be a pretty good way to read a book about math. I may move on to some Prolog in the future, which seems appropriate given the nature of Boole's work, but for now I want to focus on learning the material.

For those unware, George Boole was a largely self-taught mathmetician and philosopher. His development of Boolean algebra, a system that applies mathematical methods to logical reasoning, is one of the foundations of which computer science is based. This new branch of mathematics allowed the creation of binary code, the development of computer programming, and circuit design.

The content in this repository is the result of my own interpretations of the text and will be updated as I work through be book. I am by no means a math expert so if any of my interpretations are wrong, please let me know. Some notes may seem disjointed, incomplete, or messy as I type them down while read through the essays initially. I'll go back and refine the notes after initial reading.
