## The Mathematical Analysis of Logic

In this pamphlet, George Boole lays the groundwork for symbolic logic, bridging the gap between math and philosophy. He proposes using algebraic methods to solve logical problems which would create a new branch in mathematics known as Boolean algebra.

Boole's methodology involves the assignment of symbolic values to logical statements using operations such as AND (conjunction), XOR (disjunction), and NOT (negation).

Through examining the close relationship between mathematics and logic, George Boole builds the foundation which modern computer science is built upon.
